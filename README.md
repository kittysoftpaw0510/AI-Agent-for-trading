# AI AGENTS FOR TRADING

the main mission is to build [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) which is a focused version of agi, for trading and investing. 

the first step will be to build ai agents for trading that will eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz) and our custom trading model

as i have been training humans for the last 4 years on how to automate their trading [here in the bootcamp](https://algotradecamp.com), i know what humans have a hard time with that agents should be able to gain an edge on. 

this will all still come down to the strategies that these agents will run, but ai agents will not have the biggest problems that hand trader have which are emotions, ego, fear, inconsistent position sizing, tiredness & patience.

i will still be running the RBI framework from the above section as a human in order to find new strategies that work in the past, but now i will have an additional path to build new algos that layers agents on to profitable strategies. 

this is a new regime we have never seen before and the llms are only getting better. literally no one knows what the future holds, and that is exciting to me so i will spend my time building this ai agent platform specifically for trading, no funny business

**steps to complete**

1. risk control agents - build ai agents that can control risk for manual traders - as every trader‚Äôs worst skill is managing risk, if we build a way to have ai agents constantly running with hand traders, this should instantly make them more profitable. most will still override the agents and lose money, but its the first step in building ai agent to trade
2. exit agents - build out these agents to know when to exit. this may be kinda encapsulated in the risk control agents, but we are starting with exits opposed to entries as humans tend to have a hard time closing positions, so we need to make sure that the agents master this before entering positions
3. entry agents - build out entries, as they are less important than the exit. not necessarily, but want to make sure they can manage risk and exit first. 
4. sentiment collecting agents - we can use twitter, discord, telegram in order to get sentiment of the markets and have these agents use that to either trend or counter trend the overall sentiment
5. strategy executing agents - once we have the above risk controls, entries and exits finished, we can start layering in profitable strategies that the agents can trade. this opens the door for something interesting which is giving final decision power to the agent of whether or not it will take a trade that a system says to take. this could be good or bad. but no one knows until we test it. cool things like multi agent consensus on profitable strategies is a blue ocean that not even [Jim Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Simons) was able to test out. thats exciting
