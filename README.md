# 🤖 AI AGENTS FOR TRADING

The main mission is to build [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) - a focused version of AGI specifically for trading and investing.

## 🎯 Vision
We're building AI agents for trading that will eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz) and our custom trading models. With 4 years of experience training humans to automate their trading through our [bootcamp](https://algotradecamp.com), we understand where AI agents can gain an edge over human limitations.

## 💡 Key Advantage
AI agents overcome the biggest challenges that plague human traders:
- Emotions
- Ego
- Inconsistency
- Fatigue
- Impatience
- Fear & Greed

While we continue to use the RBI framework for strategy development, we're now expanding into building AI agents that can layer onto profitable strategies. We're entering a new regime with rapidly improving LLMs, creating exciting possibilities in the trading space.

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### 1. Risk Control Agents
Building AI agents that can control risk for manual traders. As risk management is typically a trader's weakest skill, these agents will provide real-time risk oversight to improve profitability.

### 2. Exit Agents
Developing agents specialized in position exit timing. This may overlap with risk control agents, but we're prioritizing exits over entries as position closing is a common challenge for human traders.

### 3. Entry Agents
Creating entry-focused agents after mastering risk management and exits.

### 4. Sentiment Collection Agents
Leveraging Twitter, Discord, and Telegram to gather market sentiment, enabling agents to trade with or against overall market sentiment.

### 5. Strategy Execution Agents
Implementing profitable strategies through agents with advanced features like:
- Multi-agent consensus
- Strategy validation
- Dynamic trade filtering
This opens up possibilities that even [Jim Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Simons) couldn't explore.
